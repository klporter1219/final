This application is for adding Pokémon that you have caught throughout your gameplay, to your boxes. I created this application so you can keep track of what Pokémon that you have caught, so you do not catch them a second time. This is helpful while you are doing raids and battles, and need to quickly see what Pokémon you have caught.

When you load into the website, you are redirected to the login/signup page. Here, you must create an account or login with your previous account. Once you do either, you are redirected to the add Pokémon (if you're a new user), or the box list page if you are existing user. From here, you can either search Pokémon, add Pokémon to you box list, or you can remove Pokémon from your box list. You could even logout if you are done using the website.
